<main>
<p>This lesson needs to explain the header image, that is <strong>ALL</strong> it needs to do. The “inertial reference frames” title is a bit misleading. This is more of a lessons about the “equivalency principle” and how inertial mass and gravitational mass are indistinguishable as far as we know.</p>
<p>Our device has a sensor that measures acceleration, but we have to subtract 1g from the measurement to use it for most things. Explaining this would be a nice “stretch goal” for our lessons.</p>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> need to talk about ineral forces and centripetal vs centrifugal, that would be way too advanced.</p>
<p>Suggested structure: - How do you know you are moving? By looking at things that you say are “stationary”. But there is some arbitrariness to what you call stationary. This example rely’s on sight, and seeing things pass by</p>
<p>#Outline</p>
<p>For this lesson, we’re going on a road trip, up an elevator, and on a rocket ship to explore what physicists call reference frames.</p>
<p>Road trip to lift off-site: Use a smooth rode to describe the idea of a reference frame and an inertial reference frame. Use a bumpy road or sudden stop to describe a non-inertial frame</p>
<p>Take an elevator up to the rocket ship: You have a box of supplies on a scale. Use this setting to describe part of the image.</p>
<p>Take the rocket ship far away, away from any gravity. Use this setting to finish describing the image.</p>
<hr />
<p>For this lesson, we’re going on a road trip, up an elevator, and on a rocket ship to explore what physicists call reference frames. For an introduction to reference frames, imagine you’re riding down a smooth road in a car to the lift off-site. Outside your window, you can see trees and park benches speed past your eyes. However, if you look beside you in the car, nothing has moved. Your favorite drink is still in the cupholder, and your book is still on the floor. But someone sitting on a park bench the car passed by would have a different experience. To them, the trees and park bench would be stationary, but the car and everything in it whizzed by. What is happening in this scenario? In physics terms, we would explain this by saying that the car and the park bench are in two different reference frames.</p>
<p>Assume your car is moving at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour, on a smooth, straight road. These two reference frames, the car, and the park bench are moving at constant speeds with respect to each other. Two reference frames moving at constant speeds to each other are called inertial reference frames</p>
<p>(Insert picture of reference frames)</p>
<p>Add a box that the park bench is not “stationary” by every definition, as it is attached to Earth which rotates and travels around the sun State that we won’t explore that any further in this lesson</p>
<p>——Everything below this is an old draft/ideas that need to be changed to fit the outline</p>
<p>Now imagine you are riding in an elevator, and the string suddenly breaks. You can’t see anything, so how would you know that you are falling? Now imagine with you, there was a box that weight 50 lbs on Earth. If you had a scale in the elevator and placed the box on the scale, it wouldn’t weigh anything because the entire elevator, you, and the box would be accelerating (falling).</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you know gravity is pulling you down (besides the intense sense of depression deep in your soul)? You look at whether things (or you) fall with ever increasing speed to the center of attraction if there is no support under you. But then, can you distinguish an elevator in free fall from no gravity at all (not counting the moment when you go <em>splat</em>)?</li>
</ul>
<p>-Now imagine taking your rocket ship far away to a place where there is no gravity. Just like in the elevator, if your box and a scale on board, it would not weigh anything. So we can not distinguish a frame in free fall with gravity, from a frame where there is no gravity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe also add that in the same way you can not distinguish being in a box in a gravity field from being in an accelerating box without gravity?</li>
<li>Definitely bring up that at the very start of an elevator trip you “feel” higher gravity and also lower gravity at the end of a as it is stopping. Or the inverse if the elevator is going down instead of up. This could also be explained by the idea of putting a box and scale in the elevator</li>
</ul>
<div class="further-reading">
<p>todo: Sketch that makes the spinwheel shine when it experiences acceleration. See it is dark when thrown in the air. See it is bright when shaken or rotated around holder. See it brighten up in an elevator, but only at a start of a trip.</p>
