<script src='/simspinwheel/simspinwheel.js'></script>
<p>To create an animation or a video, we need a rapid sequence of still images, called frames. The frames must be displayed rapidly enough that it looks like a smoothly changing pattern to our eyes. This is true both for the computer screen playing a video and for the SpinWheel lights changing their patterns. For example, this is a short repeating animation of a rainbow pattern playing on the LEDs.</p>
<video src="/images/behindthescenes/pretty_device.mp4" muted autoplay playsinline loop>
</video>
<p>There are two ways such a pattern can be animated on a given device or screen. The first approach is to just draw every single frame by hand, save that large collection of images, and display them one by one in a rapid succession. Frequently, this is the only possible way. For instance, in an animated movie, the majority of the frames are drawn by an artist, even if they use modern computer graphics technologies to automate some of their work. This method requires a lot of manual work, and a lot of computer memory to store the artwork.</p>
<p>However, there is another type of art, called <em>generative art</em>, which does not have such taxing requirements. It obeys different constraints, and it requires a particular mindset, but its beauty comes from the fact that you tell a computer how to create art on its own, instead of drawing the art yourself. The creative element is deep in your imagination, and it depends on your skill to instruct and teach a computer to do something. We will explore this type of art here. We will learn how to command a computer (the SpinWheel) to draw patterns of color that evolve in time. Along the way we might even learn a bit about how to write programs.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>If you haven’t already done the <a href="/quickstart">quickstart guide</a> and <a href="/basics">learning to code the SpinWheel lesson</a>, then we recommend reading them before finishing the rest of the lesson. They contain important information about downloading the software necessary to program the SpinWheel and other useful information about controlling the LEDs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we will be learning a new language, a language that lets us instruct a simple computer (the SpinWheel’s brain) to do something. Just like with any other language, at first you will not be able to understand all the words or the <span class="footnote">entire sentence.<span>In this metaphor a sentence is a computer program.</span></span> As a new programmer, the important thing is to latch on to the words that mean something to you, even if you cannot understand the entire language.</p>
<p>We have prepared many small example programs you can play with, before you start trying to modify them. All of these sketches are in the zipfile that you downloaded while completeing the <a href="/quickstart">quickstart guide</a>. You should not need to type out any of the examples described here. Simply attempt to upload them to the device and read through them, even if you are not changing them.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="timing">Timing</h2>
<p>Our first goal, before we are able to make something as advanced as the rainbow pattern above, is to simply make our device blink. Writing this code will give us the framework upon which to build more sophisticated animations.</p>
<video src="/images/bookpics/simple_blink.mp4" muted autoplay playsinline loop>
</video>
<p>To make our device blink, we need to tell it how long to be on or off. This is the timing of our animation. Thankfully our device has a built-in timer that can measure milliseconds (thousandths of a second). One of the first things we will need to do in our generative art program is to ask for the time and save it for future calculations. The necessary command that we need to write looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="dt">int</span> t = millis();</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We will shortly see how this command can be woven in with others in a whole program. Here, <code>millis()</code> is a <span class="footnote">command that reads the number of milliseconds that have passed since the device was started.<span>This command, together with many other useful commands comes built into the software we are using. We will later even learn how to make commands of our own.</span></span> These commands are special directions that ask the computer to complete a task. The rest of the small piece of code depicted above ensures that the number of milliseconds given by <code>millis()</code> is stored somewhere: in the variable we have named <code>t</code> (you can use more descriptive names if you wish). We also had to specify the type of the variable (<code>int</code> as in “integer”) because otherwise our SpinWheel will get confused.</p>
<!--FIGURE: An image showing the type and name on the lhs, and the expression on the rhs, stressing the rigidity of this syntax.-->
<p>The entirety of our animation will depend on the number stored in this <code>time</code> variable. Based on that number, another piece of code can decide when to shine a given color, when to be illuminating brightly or showing subdued colors, when to alternate hues from one LED to the other, and in this particular case, simply when to blink.</p>
<p>What follows is the most crucial concept in the construction of our animations. If we want our animations to repeat, we will need to turn this ever-growing counter <code>time</code>, into a number that <em>wraps around</em>. For instance, if we want our animation to repeat every 2500 milliseconds (2.5 seconds), then the number on which the animation depends should itself repeat in the same manner.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/Modular_division_timeline.png" title="Division of time (shown in blue) into intervals of 2500 (shown in orange)" alt="" /><figcaption>Division of time into intervals of 2500. In this example, 5600 milliseconds have passed, which is 2 full cycles with a remainder of 600.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The simplest way to do that is to subdivide time into intervals of the same length as our animation and see how many milliseconds have passed since the start of the current interval. We can do that by looking at the remainder after dividing time by the length of our repeating unit. For example, if 5600 milliseconds have passed since the device was powered, then <span class="math display">\[ 5600\div 2500 = 2 \text{ with a remainder of } 600.\]</span> This means that two full intervals of 2500 milliseconds have passed and we are 600 milliseconds into the third interval.</p>
<!--FIGURE: figure describing this division and reminder. -->
<p>We can also consider intervals of different lengths, but for now we will stick to 2.5 seconds as it is short enough for us to be able to see the animation we create without waiting an unnecessary amount of time, and long enough that our eyes can capture how things change during this interval.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to tell the computer that we want it to compute a division with remainder for us. Thankfully, we can find in our dictionary of programming languages that the notation <code>a % b</code> is <span class="footnote">frequently used<span>Programmers have the bad habit of taking established symbols like the percentage sign and using it for unrelated concepts, like its use here for division with remainder.</span></span> to mean “find the remainder of dividing <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>”. With all this knowledge, we now know how to store a new variable <code>t_repeating</code> which measures time in repeating intervals of (for example) 2500 milliseconds.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span class="dt">int</span> t_repeating = t % <span class="dv">2500</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<figure>
<video src="/images/bookpics/time_remainder.mp4" muted autoplay playsinline loop>
</video>
<figcaption>
Using a clock to create a repeating pattern: the counter in our timer (in blue) is divided in equal intervals, and the remainder of that division (in orange) provides a steady repeating sequence of numbers on which we can base a repeating animation.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="a-picture-that-depends-on-time">A picture that depends on time</h3>
<p>Finally, we have all that we need to create our first animation. We will use the timing variable we have created <code>t_repeating</code>, and based on its value we will calculate a brightness value <code>b</code>. We will use this brightness variable to set all of the large LEDs (and each of their red, green, and blue colors) to the same time-dependent value. The <span class="footnote"> important part of the necessary code <span>We skip the setup code for the sake of space</span></span>is shown in the SpinWheel simulator below. <span class="footnote">Try to explain in the words of your own language what every single line of the computer programming language says.<span>You will frequently hear programmers talk about the “story” that their code tells. Being able to retell the instructions of a piece of computer code in the form of a human-language story is a sure sign you are starting to understand a piece of code.</span></span> As a hint, we will mention that <code>setLargeLEDsUniform</code> is used to set all large LEDs to the same uniform color (specified by three numbers, corresponding to the red, green, and blue components of the color). Try to make small modifications (<a href="/colortheory">change the color from white to red</a>, make the brightness lower, etc) and run the code in the simulator by clicking the “run” button.</p>

<p>We had to divide <code>t_repeating</code> by 10, because otherwise <code>b</code> will go beyond <code>255</code>, which is the maximal permitted brightness value for our software. Now let us upload this code to the SpinWheel device itself. Connect your device with a USB cable to your computer and load the file, ready to upload, in the Arduino software. To run this code on your SpinWheel, navigate to <code>Examples → SpinWearables → Animations_and_Patterns → Simple_Blink</code> in the Arduino software and open the file. If you simply copy the above code, it will not run because it is missing the important setup information. The file in <code>Examples</code> contains the entirety of the necessary code. After you open the file, you can try some of the same modifications that you attempted in the simulator from the previous paragraph.</p>
<div class="further-reading">
<p>If you want a reminder about why the above code will not work if you run it on your SpinWheel, check out the <a href="/basics">lesson on learning to program the SpinWheel</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>We also have a <a href="/codedoc/examples/Animations_and_Patterns/Simple_Blink">webpage with detailed explanation of the code</a>, if you are interested in learning more about what each line of the code does. If you are already accustomed to programming and want to simply see the list of available commands, <a href="/allcommands">check out our function documentation</a>.</p>
<p>By learning to control the SpinWheel’s LEDs, you are learning some basic coding concepts. To expand on this, we have also put together a reference guide that introduces <a href="/progpatterns">some of the most important patterns in programming</a>.</p>
<h2 id="more-sophisticated-patterns">More sophisticated patterns</h2>
<h3 id="smoother-pulsing">Smoother pulsing</h3>
<p>There is a whole universe of patterns you can create with the SpinWheel: simply pick a piece of paper, draw the pattern you desire, and translate it to an expression of code and math that implements it. However, that much freedom can be paralysing at first. Here we will see two more functions that can give us ideas upon which to build.</p>
<p>First, notice that the brightness of the LEDs in our previous examples was abruptly cut off. Wouldn’t it be prettier if we gently turned off the LEDs, similarly to how gently we are ramping them up? We can perform this by writing a function that first goes up and then slowly goes back down. We have already written such a function for you to use and called it <a href="/codedoc/SpinWearables.h.html#triangular-wave"><code>triangularWave</code></a>, because when you plot it, it looks like a series of triangles.</p>
<figure>
<video src="/images/bookpics/triangular_wave.mp4" muted autoplay playsinline loop>
</video>
<figcaption>
Instead of the sawtooth time-dependent pattern of brightness we saw previously, we can employ a pattern that also decreases steadily (instead of abruptly dropping to zero), making for a more pleasant pulsing light.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Below you can see a small modification of our previous example that employs such triangular waves. In order to also show some color, instead of purely white LEDs, we will <a href="/colortheory">mix only red and blue, and leave the green set to zero</a>. <a href="/codedoc/examples/Animations_and_Patterns/Smoother_Blink">You can peruse the entirety of the code online</a>, or access it directly from the Arduino software from <code>Examples → SpinWearables → Animations_and_Patterns → Smoother_Blink</code>.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="the-color-wheel">The color wheel</h3>
<p>Up until now we have discussed how to turn a time-dependent number into a brightness. However, instead of having time-dependent intensity of light, we might be more interested in a time-dependent hue. One particularly lovely way to achieve this is to use a color wheel, where we assign a color to each point of a circle, and use it as a reference when turning numbers into colors.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/bookpics/colorwheel.png" title="The color wheel lets you generate a color based on a single continuously changing (maybe time-dependent) number." alt="" /><figcaption>The color wheel lets you generate a color based on a single continuously changing (maybe time-dependent) number.</figcaption>

<h3 id="non-uniform-patterns-and-accessing-separate-leds">Non-uniform patterns and accessing separate LEDs</h3>
<p>Lastly, we would like to have a pattern that illuminates different LEDs differently. To set the color of all of the larger LEDs to a single uniform color, we have already seen that we need to use <code>SpinWheel.setLargeLEDsUniform(r,g,b)</code>, where <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code> are the red, green, and blue components of the color we desire. They need to be between 0 (turned off) and 255 (maximum intensity). To do the same to the smaller LEDs, we can use <code>SpinWheel.setSmallLEDsUniform(r,g,b)</code>. To illuminate a single large LED (numbered from 0 to 7), we can use <code>SpinWheel.setLargeLED(i,r,g,b)</code>, where the first argument <code>i</code> is the number of the LED we want to change. Similarly, we use <code>SpinWheel.setSmallLED(i,r,g,b)</code> to do the same for the smaller LEDs.</p>
<p>Now we will introduce the last conceptual tool we will need. To create an interesting time-dependent pattern where different LEDs show different colors and intensities, we simply need to control each of them separately. Consider this case, in which only two of the LEDs (number 0 and number 2) are enabled, but with different patterns.</p>

<p>With these tools mastered, you might want to peruse the <a href="/allcommands">list of available functions</a>, or learn more about <a href="/sight">mixing of colors</a>. You can also delve deeper in <a href="/progpatterns">the tools that this programming language provides</a>, which could enable you to write more sophisticated programs and patterns.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions: Try to add more LEDs to your patterns. Try to have some of them (e.g. the small ones) have varying brightness, while others (e.g. the large ones) have changing colors. Mix and match code from the previous examples. Let your creativity sing through the code.</p>
<div class="further-reading">
<p>You might have noticed that many of the functions and commands we have used are set to repeat themselves when their input passes through 255. There is a reason for this. There are 256 numbers from 0 to 255. And 256 is exactly how many different values can be stored in one byte. One byte is how much space is dedicated to many typical variables in the language used by the Arduino software, hence, many of its functions are written to expect numerical values on that scale.</p>
