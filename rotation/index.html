<p>In this lesson, we’ll talk more about rotation, introducing concepts like angular velocity and polar coordinates.</p>

<!--TODO: Intro will go here.-->
<p>This lesson will focus on understanding the many things around us that spin. Whether it’s a frisbee, a tire wheel, a dancer, or even an amusement park ride, rotation is all around us. When objects are moving in straight lines, we call this linear motion. In previous lessons, we’ve discussed how to describe linear motion in terms of velocity. How about rotational motion? What tools do we have to explain this motion?</p>
<h1 id="angular-displacement">Angular Displacement</h1>
<p>When dealing with circular motion or rotation (for instance, for a ball on a string or a horse on a merry-go-round), then it is useful to describe its position using an angle (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>). The change between the original angle of the ball and its final angle is typically specified as the change in <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \theta\)</span>) and is known as angular displacement. While <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> can be defined using either degrees or radian, radians are commonly used. (which do we use?)</p>
<h2 id="add-image-of-a-ball-moving-in-a-straight-line-to-demonstrate-displacement-and-ball-on-string-with-an-angle-sketched-out-to-define-angular-displacement">add image of a ball moving in a straight line to demonstrate displacement and ball on string with an angle sketched out to define angular displacement</h2>
<h1 id="angular-velocity">Angular Velocity</h1>
<p>To describe the motion of this ball as it is spun around on a string, we use something called angular velocity. Usually when we think of velocity, we are thinking of something called linear velocity which is defined as the change in position over the time. Angular velocity is very similar, but it is instead defined as the change in angle over the time. While angular velocity and linear velocity are related they are not the same. For instance, take our ball, if we change the length of the string, we can keep our angular velocity the same, but the linear velocity will be different. You can experiment with this below:</p>
<h2 id="add-widget-where-gives-angular-and-linear-velocity-with-a-slidebar-for-the-radius-of-the-ball-spinning-around">add widget where gives angular and linear velocity with a slidebar for the radius of the ball spinning around</h2>
<p>Did you notice how as you made the string longer, the linear velocity increased but the angular velocity stayed the same? This is because to trace the larger circle at the same rate, it has to move faster when it is farther away. If you measured the linear velocity at points moving out from the origin, you could see that they steadily increase.</p>
<p>Now imagine you are riding a merry-go-round. Out of the many colorful horses, you’ve picked your favorite and are traveling around and around under flashing lights. After counting the seconds it takes to go around on time, you find that you are moving at a rate of 1 trip, or one revolution, every 10 seconds. With some conversions, this number describes your angular velocity. One revolution is equivalent to one circle, which has 360 degrees or 2Pi radians. Your speed of 1 revolution every 10 seconds can also be described as an angular velocity of 36 degrees/second or traveling – radians/second.</p>
<p>Now how would your ride be different if you choose a horse closer to the center or closer to the edge of the merry-go-round? Would your speed change? The answer depends on what speed you are talking about!! No matter where you sat on the merry-go-round, your angular speed would stay the same. The whole merry go round is moving together, so, you will rotate at a rate of 1 revolution per 10 seconds!</p>
<p>So what does change between different horses?</p>
<!--TODO: Finish this anology and integrate with the text above.-->
<h1 id="angular-acceleration">Angular Acceleration</h1>
<p>do we want to add this? If we do, we can extend the anaology to a merry-go-round stopping or starting</p>
<h1 id="polar-coordinates">Polar Coordinates</h1>
<p>In the <a href="/vectors">vectors and kinematics lesson</a>, we introduced the idea of a vector. When defining vectors in this lesson, we used something called ‘Cartesian coordinates.’ If we think of a vector connecting the origin to the point, Cartesian coordinates provide the x and y position <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span>. This is very useful for straight lines, (give more examples). In other cases, something called polar coordinates can be more useful. Polar coordinates define a vector differently. Rather than giving the x and y position, they specify the length of the vector (<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>) and its direction (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) <span class="math inline">\((r, \theta)\)</span>. This is easier to describe using a visual:</p>
<h2 id="add-visual-here-of-cartesian-vs-polar-coordinates">add visual here of cartesian vs polar coordinates</h2>
<p>caption: Here you can see how both polar and cartesian coordinates can be used to describe a point’s location.</p>
<p>It sometimes is important to switch from Cartesian to polar coordiantes or in the reverse from polar to Cartesian coordinates. <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are related to each other using the cosine function, which relates <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> to the ratio between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(cos(\theta) = x/r\)</span>). The sine function (<span class="math inline">\(sin(\theta) = y/r\)</span>) relates <span class="math inline">\(/theta\)</span> to the ratio between <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>##add visualization of this</p>
<p>Going back to our discussion above about angular displacement, you can see how polar coordinates make it easy to describe the ball’s location. Polar coordinates make it easier to describe the ball’s motion as well. By steadily increasing theta (or the angle), you can draw a circle with a specific radius.</p>
