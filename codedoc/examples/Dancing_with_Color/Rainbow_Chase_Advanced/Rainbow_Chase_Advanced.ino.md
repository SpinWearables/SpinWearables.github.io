# A Few LEDs with continuously changing colors "chasing" each other
This is a sketch based on the Rainbow_Chase example from [animations and patterns](https://spinwearables.com/animation/).
In the Animations and Patterns Activity a "delay" or "offset" between the numbers governing the
colors of a given LED was introduced to make them look as if they are chasing each other. 
Our comments in this sketch focus on the differences from that Animations 
and Patterns Adventure. In particular, we focus on how we now use rotation
rather than time to update the animation.

<div class="code">
```cpp

#include "SpinWearables.h"
using namespace SpinWearables;

void setup() {
  SpinWheel.begin();
}

int r_cum = 0;

void loop() {
  SpinWheel.readIMU();

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Here we measure the rotation around the x-axis.  
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  int r = (SpinWheel.gz);
  
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Then if the absolute value of this rotation is big
enough, we add 1 to r_cum. In the original Rainbow_Chase
example, the function millis() provided an  
equivalent value for us. This bit of code ensures that 
the color of the LEDs only cycles when the device is 
moving. You can modify the threshold like in the other
sketches for this lesson or change the number
being added to r_cum to change how quickly the LEDs 
change color.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  if (abs(r) > 50) {
    r_cum += 1;
  }

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
We will have some fixed "delay" between the
numbers controlling each LED's color.
Change this number! What happens?
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  int r_delay = 20;
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
We will turn all of the LEDs on, but the
color of each one of them will be governed by
a slightly modified number.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  int r0 = r_cum % 250;
  int r1 = (r_cum+r_delay) % 250;
  int r2 = (r_cum+2*r_delay) % 250;
  int r3 = (r_cum+3*r_delay) % 250;
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Here we finally set those colors.
Let's first turn on the large LEDs.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(0, colorWheel(r0));
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(1, colorWheel(r1));
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(2, colorWheel(r2));
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(3, colorWheel(r3));
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(4, colorWheel(r0));
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(5, colorWheel(r1));
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(6, colorWheel(r2));
  SpinWheel.setLargeLED(7, colorWheel(r3));
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Now we can turn on the small LEDs.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(0, colorWheel(r0));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(1, colorWheel(r0));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(2, colorWheel(r1));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(3, colorWheel(r1));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(4, colorWheel(r1));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(5, colorWheel(r2));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(6, colorWheel(r2));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(7, colorWheel(r2));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(8, colorWheel(r3));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(9, colorWheel(r3));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(10, colorWheel(r1));
  SpinWheel.setSmallLED(11, colorWheel(r0));
```

Draw the image that was prepared in the previous lines.

<div class="code">
```cpp
