# Dancing with Color: Create colorful snake that changes with rotation.

These include statements should look familiar!
As a reminder, they allow the program to access
coding tools for the SpinWheel.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
#include "SpinWearables.h"
using namespace SpinWearables;

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
The setup function should also seem familiar.
As a reminder, the `setup` function is run once when
the SpinWheel turns on. Also, `SpinWheel.begin()`
prepares the LED to accept new colors.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
void setup() {
  SpinWheel.begin();
}
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Initialize the angle variable to zero. This will keep
track of the Spin Wheel's rotation.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
uint8_t angle = 0; 
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Instructions in a loop function are repeated over and over again,
in other words, "in a loop".
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
void loop() {
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
The `readIMU` function checks if the sensor is ready
and takes its current rotation data.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  SpinWheel.readIMU();

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Use an **if statement** to check to see if the rotation is
large enough. If the rotation is large enough, then 
we will create a snake-like pattern on the device
where the motion of the snake is based on the motion 
of the device.  We add 5 to have the snake spin
at a reasonable speed. You can adjust this number
to change the speed at which the snake rotates.
Here we use (0,255,0) to make the 
snake green, but you can use any color you like. 
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  if (abs(SpinWheel.gx) >= 1) { 
     angle = angle + SpinWheel.gx + 5;
     setSmallLEDsPointer(angle, 0, 255, 0);
  }
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Create a pattern on the large LEDs as well. 
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  SpinWheel.setLargeLEDsUniform(100, 0, 100);
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Have the SpinWheel draw the desired pattern.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  SpinWheel.drawFrame();
}
  
```
