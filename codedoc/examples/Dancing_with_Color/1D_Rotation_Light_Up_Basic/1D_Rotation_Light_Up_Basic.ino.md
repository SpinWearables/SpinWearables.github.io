# Dancing with Color: Step x, changing color in response to rotation in the z-direction.
Here we go through in detail how to change the color of the SpinWheel in 
response to the rotation of the device. For more information and other 
examples, [click here](https://spinwearables.com/dancing/).
</div>
<div class="side-text">
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
You've probably seen these `include` statements in some of the other code examples. 
They allow the program to access a set of tools for the SpinWheel for us to use. 
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
#include "SpinWearables.h"
using namespace SpinWearables;

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
The instructions we write in the `setup` block are executed
once when the SpinWheel device powers on. We run one single instruction
called `SpinWheel.begin()` which prepares all the LEDs to accept new colors.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
void setup() {
  SpinWheel.begin();
}

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Instructions in a loop function are repeated over and over again, 
in other words, "in a loop".
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
void loop() {
 

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
The `readIMU` function checks if the sensor is ready
and takes its current rotation data, which we will
use below to change the color.  
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  SpinWheel.readIMU();

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Below we will use an **if/else statement**.
Ife statements are vital tools in programming.
Essentially, **if** a condition is true, we will 
follow the given instruction.  
In this case, if the x rotation (gx) is large enough,
then we will change the color of the large LEDS
by changing the `spinning` variable. The `abs` function 
makes it so that the direction of the rotation
(clockwise or counter clockwise), does not matter. 
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  if (abs(SpinWheel.gx) > 1) {
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
As before, the `setLargeLEDsUniform` function tells the 
SpinWheel to show the color we would like it to show. 
We will use (0,255,255), which is a light blue.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
    SpinWheel.setLargeLEDsUniform(0, 255, 255);
  }
  else {
```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Since no motion has been detected, we will instead use 
We will use (0,0,0), which turns off the LEDs.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
    SpinWheel.setLargeLEDsUniform(0, 0, 0);
  }

```
</div>
<div class="side-text">
Finally, we need to tell the SpinWheel to light up the LEDs
according to the instructions in `setLargeLEDsUniform`.
</div>
<div class="code">
```cpp
  SpinWheel.drawFrame();
 }
  
```
</div>
