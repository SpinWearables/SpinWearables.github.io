<h2 id="lights">Lights</h2>
<p>As you are reading this lesson, you are most likely surrounded by a variety of lights. Light emits from your computer screen and from the lights in your room. Light enters through your windows or open door. Light even comes from you refrigerator when you get a snack! You interact with light in various ways throughout your day; and while most of this light is white, some is more colorful. Some examples are street lights, the light creating the colors on this page, and the light coming from a hot stove top. In this lesson, we will explore the properties of light and how it creates the colors we see.</p>
<!--TODO: Needs an pretty image of light(s).-->
<p>(Colorful picture of lights goes here)</p>
<h3 id="rainbows-and-white-light">Rainbows and White Light</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by talking about white light and rainbows. When light travels from the Sun, or most other sources of illumination, we perceive it as lacking a hue. We call this white light. In reality, white light is a mixture of many colors of light. This mixture can be seen by using a prism to split out the different colors that make up the mixture.</p>
<!--TODO: Needs a picture of a prism with colored lights.-->
<p>(Prism picture here)</p>
<p>Do you see how white light goes into the prism and the entire spectrum of colors emerges from the other side?</p>
<p>What is happening here? We are witnessing the process of dispersion when we see white light spread out into its different colors. Dispersion is a property of waves, and causes waves to be separated by their wavelengths. By studying the dispersion of light, and many other studies we won’t discuss here, we have learned that light is an electromagnetic wave. Let’s break that idea down and study the general properties of waves and then look more at electromagnetic waves.</p>
<h2 id="light-is-an-electromagnetic-wave">Light is an Electromagnetic Wave</h2>
<h3 id="waves-are-travelling-motion">Waves are travelling motion</h3>
<p>A wave is a repetitive motion traveling through a medium. Some examples are shown in the table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Type of Wave</strong></th>
<th><strong>Medium</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Ocean wave</td>
<td>Water</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Sound wave</td>
<td>Air</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Light</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Interestingly, a wave can travel long distances without needing the medium itself to travel that full distance. For instance, the crests of an ocean wave can be ridden all the way to the shore, but very little of the water actually moves closer to shore. The water mainly moves up and down at the same location. A great example of this is when a crowd of people performs “The Wave” while at a sports event. If everyone works together, the wave can propagate throughout the entire stadium, but each individual remains in their original location, simply moving up and down when the wave passes through them.</p>
<!--TODO: Picture of various types of waves and maybe of people doing the wave? -->
<h3 id="properties-of-waves">Properties of Waves</h3>
<p>Waves are characterized by their frequency, wavelength, and speed. Wavelength describes the length of one wave, or the distance between the peaks. You can use the widget below to change the wavelength of a wave (This widget will not display properly in Safari).</p>

<p>The frequency of a wave describes how often the repetitive motion of a wave is repeated. We describe this motion in Hertz (Hz), which stands for the number of waves per second. For example, a wave with a frequency of 3 Hz repeats its motion 3 times in one second. Finally, the speed of a wave describes how fast the wave moves forward. Sound and light are both waves but they have different speeds. During a thunderstorm, you see lightning flash before you hear the boom of thunder even though both waves started in the same location. This is because the speed of a sound wave is 343 m/s (meters per second), while the speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s.</p>
<div class="further-reading">
<p>For comparison, a highway speed limit of 60 miles per hour is about 27 m/s.</p>

<p>(add image of both wave length and frequency for one wave)</p>
<p>You may have noticed that, as you changed the wavelength in the widget, the color also changed. This is because the wavelength of light controls its color with red light having a long wavelength and purple light having a shorter wavelength. Light with a wavelength between 380 and 700 nanometers is called the visible spectrum. This is the light that our eyes can see; but light exists outside of that range. The whole spectrum of light is called the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Looking at this spectrum, you can see that different wavelengths of light create microwaves that help to heat your food, and radio waves that allow you to listen to your favorite music. We can’t see microwaves or radio waves like we can see visible light but we interact with these waves in other ways.</p>
<div class="further-reading">
<p>How small is a nanometer? There are 1,000,000,000 nanometers in one meter. For comparison, human hair is about 50,000 nanometers in diameter.</p>

<h3 id="electromagnetic-waves">Electromagnetic Waves</h3>
<p>Finally, if visible light is part of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, what exactly is an electromagnetic wave? Electromagnetic waves are waves, like sound waves or ocean waves. Instead of traveling vibrations in the air or water, they are vibrations of … it is complicated. There are many metaphors we can use to describe the medium of electromagnetic waves. Studying its inner workings has led to some of the greatest discoveries in Physics: general relativity and quantum mechanics. Instead of retracing the steps of physicists over two hundred years, we have focused on describing light, based on what we can measure about it, such as its wavelength.</p>

<h3 id="light-waves-and-color">Light Waves and Color</h3>
<p>Let’s wrap up by discussing how light waves impact the colors we see.</p>
<p>When we look at an object, we see its color. But how does this happen? The answer to this question can be explained in terms of reflection, absorption, transmission. When light travels through different mediums, interesting things happen. A neat property of light is that it travels differently through different materials. One example is that light travels at a different speed in the air than in water. Each time light travels from one material to another, it can be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. When light is reflected, it bounces off the interface where the materials meet and travels in the other direction. When it’s absorbed, the light stops traveling in the new material, and this can result in heat. This is why your black shirt gets hot in the sun; it absorbs a lot of light. Finally, light can be transmitted, which means the light keeps traveling in the new material.</p>
<p>When the light in the room hits the object, some of the light is absorbed by the color pigments in the object, while the rest is reflected. If an object absorbs all colors of light except for blue, the blue light wave will reflect off of the object and travel until it hits another object. When it hits our eyes, we see the blue light and describe the object as blue. In order to see any object, some of the light must be reflected to your eye. The wavelengths of light that are reflected control what color we see.</p>
