<p>Elise’s Outline for the lesson</p>
<p>Vectors are a method of describing motion such as displacement, velocity and acceleration. In vectors, a motion is defined by its magnitude and direction. For simplicity, lets study displacement, the amount an object has moved relative to it’s starting location.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are standing in the middle of an empty school cafeteria. The floor is tiled with squares that are 1 foot wide. We will imagine that a giant coordinate system has been drawn on the floor and you are standing at the location x = 0 and y = 0.</p>
<p>(add image)</p>
<p>If you take a step forward, we can define the magnitude of your displacement vector by comparing your final and initial positions. In this case, the magnitude is 1 foot because you are 1 foot from your starting position. The direction of your movement is defined using an angle. This requires agreeing on how to describe the direction. If we were looking at a map, we might agree to describe the direction relative to North. For vector motion, scientists, mathematicians and others have agreed to describe the direction of a vector in terms of the angle relative to east, or the x-axis. In this case, if you have moved towards the door in the image, you have moved north, or with an angle of 90 degrees from the x-axis.</p>
<p>If your friend, who has joined you in this adventure, moves 1 step to the right from the center of the cafeteria, she will have also moved with a magnitude of 1 foot. But her direction will be 0 degrees.</p>
<p>(add image with diagonal motion) Now, lets move back to the center of the cafeteria and move on a diagonal one tile. This motion is the combination of moving one foot up and one foot to the right. The magnitude is the distance of the diagonal (sqrt(2)) and the direction is 45 degrees. Try moving in various directions and distances using the widget below and see how the magnitude and direction change.</p>
<p>Widget: allow user to input coordinates, draw the vector and output the magnitude and direction</p>
<p>So far, we have only discussed displacement vectors. But vectors can be used to represent many different quantities. Of importance to the Spinwheel is the representation of velocity. Instead of measuring the amount and direction an item has moved, we can measure the speed and direction, giving a velocity vector. In the video below, a ball is rolling down a slope. The vector to represent this motion has a magnitude of 5 meters per second and a direction of 330 degrees.</p>

<p>Use of angles to represent direction</p>
<p>example of a ball rolling down a slope</p>
<p>We can describe motion through the competing forces acting on an object</p>
<p>Kinematics encompasses motion of objects through space by describing their speed and direction.</p>
